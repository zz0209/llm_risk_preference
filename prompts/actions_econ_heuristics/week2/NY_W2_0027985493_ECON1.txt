Causal background (state-level):
Variables and causal roles for daily go-to-work decision under infection risk

- Confirmed
  - Definition: Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases to date in the state.
  - Causal: Higher cumulative infections imply broader historical spread and lingering prevalence in social networks, raising the baseline probability of encountering an infectious person at work.

- Deaths
  - Definition: Cumulative confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in the state.
  - Causal: Greater mortality signals disease severity and increases the expected cost of infection, making the worker require larger benefits to justify going to work amid exposure.

- Active
  - Definition: Estimated currently active COVID-19 cases in the state.
  - Causal: A larger actively infectious pool directly increases the chance of exposure during commuting and on-site interactions, tilting the decision toward staying home.

- Case_Fatality_Ratio
  - Definition: Share of confirmed cases resulting in death (CFR).
  - Causal: A higher CFR raises the expected harm conditional on infection, so even at the same exposure probability the expected loss from going to work is higher.

- Total_Test_Results
  - Definition: Total number of tests performed (specimens) to date.
  - Causal: Greater testing lowers under-detection and uncertainty in other metrics, enabling more reliable risk assessments; limited testing may understate prevalence and lead to overly risky work decisions.

- People_Tested
  - Definition: Total number of unique individuals tested to date.
  - Causal: Broader coverage reflects better surveillance of the population, so decisions rely on truer prevalence rather than repeat-testing artifacts, improving calibration of willingness to work.

- People_Hospitalized
  - Definition: Cumulative number of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
  - Causal: Higher hospitalizations indicate more severe disease burden and possible healthcare strain, increasing the expected cost of getting sick and discouraging on-site work when exposure is nontrivial.

Stratified domain knowledge derived from persona:
- AGE7=55–64 (salience 0.85): Elevated risk of severe outcomes increases expected loss from infection, lowering acceptance of high-contact roles without strong safeguards.
- P_DENSE=Suburban (salience 0.7): Moderate density and car-oriented mobility produce intermediate exposure, making workplace controls and household spillover the pivotal factors.
- HHINCOME=$150,000 or more (salience 0.6): Abundant flexibility and security render on-site exposure largely discretionary, favoring remote work and stringent safeguards.
- EDUCATION=Bachelors degree (salience 0.55): Professional roles often permit remote work and paid leave, decreasing necessity to accept infection risk for income continuity.
