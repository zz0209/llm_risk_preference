Causal background (state-level):
Variables and causal roles for daily go-to-work decision under infection risk

- Confirmed
  - Definition: Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases to date in the state.
  - Causal: Higher cumulative infections imply broader historical spread and lingering prevalence in social networks, raising the baseline probability of encountering an infectious person at work.

- Deaths
  - Definition: Cumulative confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in the state.
  - Causal: Greater mortality signals disease severity and increases the expected cost of infection, making the worker require larger benefits to justify going to work amid exposure.

- Active
  - Definition: Estimated currently active COVID-19 cases in the state.
  - Causal: A larger actively infectious pool directly increases the chance of exposure during commuting and on-site interactions, tilting the decision toward staying home.

- Case_Fatality_Ratio
  - Definition: Share of confirmed cases resulting in death (CFR).
  - Causal: A higher CFR raises the expected harm conditional on infection, so even at the same exposure probability the expected loss from going to work is higher.

- Total_Test_Results
  - Definition: Total number of tests performed (specimens) to date.
  - Causal: Greater testing lowers under-detection and uncertainty in other metrics, enabling more reliable risk assessments; limited testing may understate prevalence and lead to overly risky work decisions.

- People_Tested
  - Definition: Total number of unique individuals tested to date.
  - Causal: Broader coverage reflects better surveillance of the population, so decisions rely on truer prevalence rather than repeat-testing artifacts, improving calibration of willingness to work.

- People_Hospitalized
  - Definition: Cumulative number of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
  - Causal: Higher hospitalizations indicate more severe disease burden and possible healthcare strain, increasing the expected cost of getting sick and discouraging on-site work when exposure is nontrivial.

Stratified domain knowledge derived from persona:
- AGE7=45–54 (salience 0.85): Rising severity risk and accumulated career capital increase caution, preferring remote or well-controlled settings before working in person.
- P_DENSE=Urban (salience 0.7): High density and transit elevate baseline exposure, pushing decisions toward remote work or strong mitigation to justify on-site presence.
- HHINCOME=Under $10,000 (salience 0.6): Severe liquidity constraints and low buffers increase willingness to accept exposure to maintain income despite high downside risk.
- EDUCATION=Bachelors degree (salience 0.55): Professional roles often permit remote work and paid leave, decreasing necessity to accept infection risk for income continuity.

You need to do this survey question:
{
  "Variable": "ECON2",
  "Variable Label": "How many hours did you work last week at all jobs?",
  "options": [
    {
      "Value": 777,
      "Value Label": "(777) DON'T KNOW"
    },
    {
      "Value": 998,
      "Value Label": "(998) SKIPPED ON WEB"
    },
    {
      "Value": 999,
      "Value Label": "(999) REFUSED"
    }
  ],
  "Category": "action",
  "Condition": {
    "depends_on": "ECON1",
    "equals": 1
  }
}

Answer format for ECON2: Output a single integer number of total hours worked last week (0-168). Do NOT output 777, 998, or 999. Do NOT include any words, units, or punctuation. If uncertain, infer and provide your best estimate as an integer. Return only the number.
